A project homework of Introduction to Neuroscience by computer science students.

An agent constructed with neuron-like computing unit.The information of the last layer will be unified by a ddm module to make decision.

The agent is trained with CEM.

The result shows that our agent can achieve sound performance and can evolve to develop memory,because it outperform dense-ppo in our partial-observable environment.
